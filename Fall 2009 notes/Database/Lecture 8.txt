Guest Speaker

Computer Science Engineer - working at Emerson.
- he thought he was gonna be a web developer
- is actually an internet administrator
   - all the publication websites up.
- uses ASP / sharepoint running on .NET.

lots of C++ programmers.
- he is high-level programmer, database / HLL.

3 layers in .NET architecture
- application layer/business layer
- Business layer
- Data layer


Object-Oriented Programming
- encapsulation
- inheritance
- polymorphism
  an automatic mechanism will be used by each function
  
.NET Classes
- Dataset classes  interface w/ a cache.  you manipulate the cache however you want and then update the DB.  Dataset class is independent of underlying data sources.  

ADO vs. ADO.NET
old way w/ Connection, Command, Recordset.
Now you have Connection/Transaction, Command, and DataSet/DataReader/DataAdapter.

remember Transactions let you roll back stuff.

.NET data providers are meant to be lightweight.

Defining a connection:
- connection string is a property of the connection, whose parameters are separated by semicolons.

Open and CLose connection method.
- once you close a connection it will be removed.

Command Object Diagram.

Command Object
- commandobject is reference to a SQL statement or stored procedure.
- you need enough permissions to be able to see the procedures.
- lets you have the select statements etc. stored on the main server.

objects have methods and properties.

showed us some VB .NET code.

The ADO.NET classes are organized into nested sets of collections.
once dataset is populated & on your cache, you can use the DataAdapter,
such as UpdateCommand, DeleteCommand.

Fill - ? select statement?

The dataset creates a container of tables.    you must call DataBind to get the database to apply the values.
