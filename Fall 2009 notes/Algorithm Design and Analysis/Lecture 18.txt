Binary Search Trees
-chapter 3
know definition, basic operations, and performance of this.

AVL trees
-definition
- height
- trinode restructuring
- basic operations by trinode restructuring
-running time mfor basic operations

Splay trees
-definition
-cost of splaying

Heap sort
-definition of heap
-insertion and deletion from a heap
-how does heap sort work?

Greedy method
-definition
-greedy choice property
-Fractional Knapsack Problem (be able to solve using greedy method)
- task scheduling problem (give / solve examples, what is it, etc.)

Dynamic Programming
- definition
-matric chain multiplication - how it is solved
-properties of the programs that it can be applied to
-how it can be applied ot the Knapsack problem

String Matching
-depends how much we cover today.

Final Exam question outline
- 25 true/false questions (any topic even midterm material)
- 3 definition questions (will make it clear where we need to provide definitions - if we are unsure if we need to define elsewhere, raise hadn)
- 3 short problem solving question
- 1 long problem solving question


Final Wednesday 5:00 PM at ALKEK 102

- is the removal in a splay tree different than the removal of a binary tree, or if it's just that we do splaying afterward.  we do splaying in sort / search / delete.  depending on the definition we are splaying different things.


Pattern matching - matching part of a sequence to a pattern.
we can think of it as matching pixels as well, if you wanted, or any other item made up of discrete components.

examples of alphabets: ASCII, Unicode, {0, 1}, {A, C, G, T}

P be a string of size m
pattern matching - find substring that matches the pattern P.
T is the text of length n.


running time: nm.


if we have a table with the occurrence of our alphabet letters we can speed this up.

might be t/f on brute force / boyer-moore.


Boyer-moore's algorithm runs in O(nm+s) but for real--life problems it's much faster than brute-force.
What does the 's' stand for?
JACKET!
