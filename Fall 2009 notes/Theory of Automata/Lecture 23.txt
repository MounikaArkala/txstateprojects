P - set of languages such that there is a deterministic turing machine that decides it in polynomial time.
NP - set of languages such that there is a nondeterministic turing machine taht decides it in polynomial time.

maximal - you cannot include 1 more node and still make it independent.
maximum - largest among those maximals.  this is a definition everywhere, not just for independent sets.

maximum implies maximal, but not the other way around.


independent set

Lnew is NP-complete because all languages are reducable to it... so we just need a first NP-complete problem, then we can try to reduce other langauges to it.

if someone can find this Lold, the first one, other problems are easy to determine they are complete.

Cook and Levin found the first one, SAT.  they proved SAT was np-complete.

it's easier to establish a reduction once you become familiar w/ the existing, proved NP-Hard problem.  These "classical problems".

read about the coloring problems, he's not gonna test us on it but we should read them anyway.

final is easy :P
