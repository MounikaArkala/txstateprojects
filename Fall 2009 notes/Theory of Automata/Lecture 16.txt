backus-naur form for Java...
HTML also is context-free.

structure in english - the final string is ambiguous, unless you use brackets.  if we use a tree it is clear what the meaning is.  Parse Trees.

need to read textobok to understand arithmetic grammar.

Inherent Ambiguity - some langauges have property that every grammar for themi s ambiguous - you cannot find a grammar for the language that is NOT ambiguous.  It may still be context-free.

we want to get rid of ambiguity, but not at expense of losing useful parse trees.

Sergey Brin's friend : don't say 'something which' 'that which' - no ambiguity.  make sure it's known what you're talking about.

Just recognizing
- we need a devices similar to FSM but with more power.

before defining our PDA formally...
- it's defined as nondeterministic.
DFSM = NDFSM = regular language
NDPDA = context-free language > DPDA
PDA in our case by default refers to NDPDA.

NDPDA accepts context-free languages, DPDA is less-powerful.

for each NDFSM we can come up with an equivalent DFSM (so we say they have the same power in terms of accepting languages)
but for a PDA this is not the case.  NDPDA are more powerful.  some context-free languages cannot be recognized by DPDAs.

When you use JFLAP for PDA, it won't work.  The definition in TFLAB is different from ours.  There is a difference.  Assignment 5 has a quesiton... "for an FSM you can test it in JFLAP but in a context free language you probably can't test in JFLAP.  how to make it work?"  But you can use JFLAP to draw you just probably can't test.
