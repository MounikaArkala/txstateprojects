

Godel friends w/ Einstein and very smart.

DFSM:

Yields relations: "w" is longer by 1 symbol.

computations: 
all possible configurations that  it has gone through in a path
does C0 yeilds C2?  yes does C0 yield Cn?  yes

does any configuration yield itself?

-- parity checking.


checking consecutive characters ( no two are the same) he has a state diagram for it.

the FSM about recognizing AEIOU in order, he forgot to put a NO state.

FSM's predate computers.  The Prague Orloj, built in 1410.  a clock.  Guy that built it was killed so he couldn't build another one.

abacus also FSM.

for regular langauges, any nondeterministic FSM, there is a related DFSM, for context-bound languages.  context-free languages don't have this correspondence necessarily (but  may sometimes.)
