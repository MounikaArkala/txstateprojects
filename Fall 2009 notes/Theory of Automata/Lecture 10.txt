

Assignment 1 was pretty easy, 2 was second-easy.  3-on will be same level.

good book:
Automata Theory, Languages, and computation.

analysis of algorithms
- theory of computation started out as mathematics.

John Nash - nash equivalism.  knowing the other side's strategy, come up w/ your own strategy to win the game. They both find strategies for one to win.

some formal languages, context-sensitive (we don't talk much about these)
recursive languages...

we don't have context-free expressions.. 

chomsky hierarchy - bunch of different levels for languages/grammars.

Chomsky Normal Form - CNF - context-free grammar.  most modern proglan's are CFG.

Kleene uses regular expressions.

regular expression...

FSM = finite state machine.
D = deterministic.

Regular language : M is FSM so the language L(M) is a regular language.
if M is DFSM and { } is in L(M), then the start state of M msut be an accepting state.

"configuration of a DFSM M is an element of:"
K x Sigma*
