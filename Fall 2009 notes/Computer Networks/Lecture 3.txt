Asynchronous - VBR.  Synchronous is constant.

Internet - connectionless Packet network.

to reorder packets on a router, you must have room to store them temporarily.  you also need to certify headers are intact before forwarding.

Application QoS : QoS that uses underlying network's QoS.

if the bit rate is constant, then the mean Bit Error Rate is constant, based on the probability of corrupted bits.

unreliable service - best-try or best-effor service.
IP drops corrupt headers, forwards corrupt data portions (can't tell if data is right.)

Ethernet layer also does checksum on its layer.

choice of block sizes - smaller block sizes higher overhead, but bigger blocks more likely to be corrupted.

QoS parameters

server has an MTU so say your packet sizes are 16000 bits, you wo n't actually be able to transfer that much.

constant-data-rate streams will often get different priorities with QoS so, for example, you can pass video through.

 NIC - network interface card.  typically Etehrnet (used to be token-ring.)
 
 baseband transmission is very simple and easy, but it has a lot of problems.
