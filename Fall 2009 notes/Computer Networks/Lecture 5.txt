Assignment 1 due next week.

bandwidth/delay prouct - # of bits that can sustain in a channel.
we need to encode /decode - a bit pattern in a signal represent 

memory-cpu communication used to be bit-serial.  now it's changed to bit-parallel.
piso - from CPU - parallel in, serial out.
SIPO shift register used on other end.

for every 11 bits, 3 are control, 8 are data.  this is how we achieve character synchronizaiton in async transmission (eg. for keyboard sending).

bit synchronization - worst case is when signal keeps switching polarity.

-- when data rate inreases (sende rsends more bits per second) - duration of each bit decreases.

relation b/w duraiton and bit rate: data rate R bits per second, 

because of control bits, data rate differs from transmission rate.

-- manchester encoding.

-- differential manchester encoding.
    
HW is due next time (30th.)

Lecture 4 
- transparencies not in lecture notes, they're in powerpoints only.

arq - automatic repeat request.

communication channel is precious resource.  we want to maximize usage.  we want to have every section of channel always has data bits traveling.

transmission delay - getting bit from comp through NIC to ethernet.  propagation is time between computers.

utilization delay... 

utilization...?  some formulas.

1kbps and 50,000km , Tp = 167 ms and 250 bits are the most you can use.  a small portion of the link is idle.

data rate of 1mbps, 250000 bits, so a frame of 1000 bits occupies a tiny fraction of line.  a big portion of channel is not used.  .2% utilization.


he will post directions for submitting homework online.
ask questions about homework on forums.
