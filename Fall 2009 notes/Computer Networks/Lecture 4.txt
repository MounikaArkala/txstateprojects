Modulated transmission - amplitude-modulated: a sine wave is sent.  if it's oscillating w/ a low amplitude, it's a 0, high amplitude is a 1.

Homework is due in 2 weeks.

copper flowing through wires converts energy to heat.

- cable : a 75-ohm cable is important for internet, 50-ohm is digital transmission only.
imagine the amount of bandwidth for cable.  

wavelength is inversely proportional to frequency.
lambda(f) = u

optical fiber - carries transmitted information in form of a fluctuating beam of light in a class fiber.  

optical fiber transmission modes - monomode is best? why is that?

satellite - for TV it's download only, for communication it's two-way.

terrestrial microwaves - similar to satellites but not as reliable (more interference.)

the more harmonics, the higher bandwidth of channel is needed.

signal is composed of many sine waves of increasing frequency.  the single binary signal is composed of these.

amplification = gain.  gain is positive amplification, attenuationn is negative amplification.
P1 is transmitted and P2 is received power.  Amplitude is
10 log10 (P1/P2) dB

white noise - elecrtical movement generates signals.

bandwidth-delay product - product of link bandwidth and propogation delay.
