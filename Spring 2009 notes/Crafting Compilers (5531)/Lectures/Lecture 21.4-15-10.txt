nobody took on projects besides the compilers so we're not gonna have presentations.

final is on May 11th.

we will cover
- memory heirarchy transformations

- locality

the Memory Wall
- processor speed is increasing exponentially, memory speed is increasing linearly.

number of cores per socket is going up and bandwidth per core is not going up as fast either.

-- when you deal with tiling, try to find stuff of 8 or 16 or whatever, don't do 7 or something,
you'll mess up your temporal locality.
