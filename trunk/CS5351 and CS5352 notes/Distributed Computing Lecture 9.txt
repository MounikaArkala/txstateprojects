Thursday he will announce the final date.

In lamport's algorithm there are requirements on the equality of timestamps,
but Vector timestamps modify this.

Vector timestamps: look better.  P1 P2 P3 are always true.

Global States: basic concept is simple, although it tends to get fairly tedious.
given a set P of N processes,
a global state is a collection of states s1, s2, ... , sN  (state of all processes at a current time.)

Why are we interested in global states?
-global knowledge
-lots of advantages
- distributed systems / algorithms - one important characteristic is that each process only knows part of the state.
if a processor knows the global state it's a "centralized" algorithm.  this lets us solve a lot of problems easily.

cuts of histories:
if produced by consistent cut, it's a consistent history.
if produced by inconsistent cut we can not use it normally.

Runs & consistent runs
run - total ordering of all events in global history H that is consistend w/ local history's ordering.

global state predicate, stability, safety and liveness.

Safety - from state So, a deadlock cannot follow.
Liveness - 

Read definitions - you will realize that it's simple.  if you're confused, just read it more.
Definitions are based on each other, so you need to build on them.

Tomorrow he will be either here or San Marcos.
