
talking about Java RMI w/ sercurity codes.  he modified weather forecast example code.

Java RMI security - connecting to outside computers - writing to local file - calling other classes,
there are potential security problems.

how hard is it gonna be?
final is curved.  he can give any difficulty he deems appropriate.  if it's easy, half the people make a 100...
difficult, highest 85 lowest 65.  He will scale the exam in any case.

he doesn't do 90 pts = a, 80 pts = b, etc.  he just goes based on performance of the overall class.

open-book exams tend to be harder.
Java compiler will do marshalling/unmarshalling automatically based on the interface.

how does server differentiate between clients?
- server -> client message contents.  first substring: client#

if you use port #, it's assigned randomly by computer.  you won't know which port # are which clients.
so you'll have to have a mapping.

in this simulation we don't care what message the client is sending to the server.
server has to know which message from which client it is so it's like "this is first message from first client"
and look up in its table what 

# of files you can support is the number of clients you use.

client 1 -> first message, server has 0 in droplist, replies.  server sets next message to 1.
client 1 -> next message, server has 1 in droplist, drops.  

question 1 - is message ID in client the message # or the retries?
question 2 - run multiple programs for client or no?

he goes over the WeatherBean class which implements the Serializable interface.
values contained in the class can therefore be marshalled / unmarshalled.

on Monday we'll see how it uses array?
