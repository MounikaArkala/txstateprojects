Hello!  This site will eventually have much much more content.  Currently the only thing that exists is an old<br />
WordPress blog I kept on my trip to Seattle after I finished my B.S. in C.S.<br />
See <a href="./blog/">here</a> for the blog.<br /><br />

I plan to have a (hopefully) detailed account of all the weird projects I start and hopefully finish.<br />
At least I plan to have an updating little log of their progress even if I don't finish, so if others<br />
wish to inherit the project at some point, they will be able to.<br />
Here's a little taste of projects I've worked on that I'll eventually make pages about...<br />
<p>
I am currently creating the projects site, so it's very 
<strong>beta</strong> now, but you can find it <a 
href="/projects/">here</a><br />

 Music:<br />
<ul>
<li>Talkbox out of PVC pipe and tubing and an old speaker I had laying around</li>
<li>A complete revamp of a 3-pickup guitar's switching system, so you have complete control of phase of each pickup<br />
 as well as whether they're wired in series or parallel, and a killswitch was added as well.</li>
</ul>

Audio:<br />
<ul>
<li>I installed an amplifier and subwoofers in my car, but I didn't take pictures and there are<br />
plenty of articles on doing this elsewhere so there probably won't be an article about this one.<br />
</li>
<li> CMOY headphone amp - I built one from scratch into an Altoids tin, works fantastically and sounds very good.
</li>
</ul>
 
Programming (completed projects):<br />
<ul>
<li>WhirlGen, an interpreter for the Whirl esoteric programming language</li>
</ul>
Programming (in-progress projects):<br />
<ul>
<li>PyNES (Pronounced "pines") - a Python NES emulator.  This is the first major project I've made using<br />
agile programming techniques.  Currently I have the full 6502 implemented, and it's cycle-accurate, has memory<br />
mirroring, and has unit tests that validate for every single opcode.  (Note this is not a guarantee that it's<br />
bug-proof, just that it's been reasonably tested, and any bug-fixes can be checked to make sure they don't<br />
create any more bugs in other areas.)<br />
</li>
</ul>

Programming (abandoned? projects):<br />
<ul>
<li> walking distance calculator - ask for a route around campus, it will tell you the estimated walking distance.<br />
 Was based on a document called <u>Walking Distance.pdf</u> which I've heard from multiple sources is actually quite inaccurate,<br />
 and at the prospect of gathering all this information myself I decided it'd be better to stop there.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
<br />
I will probably also post reviews of various things I like, and rants about various things I dislike.<br />
anyway, I hope this page will change soon, and to further my hopes and dreams, I'll timestamp the bottom of<br />
this article with the last-modified date so I will be shamed into updating it if I wait too long.<br />
<br />
