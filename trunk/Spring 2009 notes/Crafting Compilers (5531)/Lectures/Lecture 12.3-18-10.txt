in scanning/parsing we did the formal approach.
for semantic analysis we adopt ad-hoc methods.

context-sensitive grammar - relax constraint of CFG that you can only have nonterminals on LHS -
the only restriction is that the length of the RHS has to be higher than LHS, so you are always doing an expansion.

Attribute grammar - every symbol in grammar can have attribute associated with it.

-you have your production rules
- in example we used it to parse the tree, but also propagate values upward, so by the time you're done w/ the
 parsing you will have the value of your expression.
 
inherited attribute
- gets influence from parsing nodes above it in the parse tree, to determine context.

Next time we'll talk about ad-hoc techniques that are used in compilers.
it's good to learn about attribute grammars because a lot of ad-hoc techniques borrow from attribute grammars.

for your assignment you don't necessarily need to use an attribute grammar.
