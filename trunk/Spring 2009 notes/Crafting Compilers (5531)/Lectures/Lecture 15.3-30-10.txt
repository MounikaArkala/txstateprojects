steps to getting working code generation:
1) creating a runtime environment, keeping track of variable locations, etc.

2) generate code for a function call
 - several tasks you need to do
 - evaluate actual parameters ( could be expression of any kind - eg a funciton call)
 
PC - should never modify the value of PC explicitly.

"segment" vs "section" - used interchangeably in intel architecture.
- code and data should be separated.

code is also operated in "segments" which are variable-sized pages.  most modern OS's don't do this.

typically when you get a "segmentation fault" it means you are accessing a page that hasn't been allocated for you.


every time you hit a call site you do the 4 things...
building the return tables, etc. etc.
