Project Report

I have implemented everything except for the interrupts.  So sometimes the clients do not get the collision messages when they should.
I tried fcntl and asynch I/O for a long time but I couldn't get either to work reliably.

There are still quite a few collisions and the BEBO and networking code works perfectly, as well as the multithreaded server.

I used TCP for the project rather than UDP.

There are frames and SDP and CBP and everything.

Time slots used was 100 microseconds.

I have it set up for 3 clients but it works for more clients as well.  If you would like to change the # of clients please see client.c, it's
a #define at the top called CLIENTS.



The format of my input files are
client_id
message_destination_id
message_destination_id
message_destination_id
message_destination_id
message_destination_id
message_destination_id
message_destination_id
message_destination_id
....
message_destination_id



I.E.
1
2
4
2
3
4
3



Would assign the client the clientID 1 and send messages to 2, 4, 2, 3, 4, 3.  the frame # is automatically incremented.
