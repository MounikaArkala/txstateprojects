Practice rotations for zig/zag in splaying!!!!

This is a left-right grandchild, NOT right-left!  You go from the grandchild and see which subtree of its parent (the main parent's child node) it is a member, then go to the parent and see which subtree its 

zig-zag represents left-right and right-left case, it means rotaion in one way then rotation in another way.

spolaying - we don't have any height restraints on the tree, so splaying may not keep the tree balanced.

AVL tree - binary search tree, all children of each node 


height of node - what is this?
depth is # of ancestors, height is maximum depth of external node.


locality - we propagate the most popular search items to the top.

a splay tree is a binary search tree wehre a node is splayed after it is accesssed (for a search or update).
deepest internal node accessed is splayed.
splaying costs O(h) where h is the height of the tree which is still O(n) worst-case.
each of the O(h) rotations takes O(1).

basically the splay tree emphasizes locality.



amortized analysis - 



...?

he coevered cost ratings of the various operations on splaying trees.

he's going to use a differnet counting method.
