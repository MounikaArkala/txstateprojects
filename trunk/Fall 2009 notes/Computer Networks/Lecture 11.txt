We're still in Lecture 7 material
one of the 'cracks' in lecture 8 is that we don't cover signals very much.
basically if there's an error in the "read" function it will return -1,
but it sets global val errno to the value of the error.
if errno == EINTR (error_interrupt) then we just try a read again.
if it's not EINTR then there was some unrecoverable error and we have to abort.


pg. 43 of 46 in Lecture7 contains example code.

Lecture 8:
why Complete queue is so low?
connections are very short, and do not stay in connection queue very long, so they end up in the Complete queue very fast.
