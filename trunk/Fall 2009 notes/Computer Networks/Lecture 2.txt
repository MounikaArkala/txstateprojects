
philosophers try to talk to each other.
one can only speak english, one French.

7 is the magic # of layers in the OSI model.

Data link layer - break message up into its max size message and then re-assemble on other side.
also needs to detect loss of messages, retransmit, fix duplicates, control flooding, and piggyback.

Protocol staccks: inernet protocol stack.  All the layers add their own data to each packet.

PCI 3, 4, 5 can possibly be changed through the senders/receivers a message must pass through.
transport layer data will not be interpreted by any intermediate routers.

circuit-switching and packet-switching networks.  TCP doesn't require physical connections.
-- TCP is logical connection.

ARPAnet project - current internet is descended from it.
started w/ a group of IMPs (interface message processors) connected w/ 56k modems.

CSNET - connects all the CS departments in US. not real network like ARPANET.
National Science Foundation - 3 bill budget, NIH - 40 bill, DoD - 400 bill.
NSF didn't have enough money to set up CSNET, but they couldn't lay the infrastructure, so
they had you connect to each other with whatever infrastructure you had (eg. telephone lines).
e-mail was main service.

NSFNET - people bitching because NSF was helping CSNET.  NSFNET sought to connect all US-based institutions,
even ones w/o CS dept's.

ANSNET sold to AOL.

he simplifies ATM network too much.
ATM links - 155 mbps and 622 mbps.
155mbps chosen to accommodate HDTV & for compatibility w/ SONET.
future of ATM
- relatively new tech (25-30 years old), ATM accepted well, integrated into PSTN and Internet.
all major carriers run ATM networks.
- due to emergence of all-optical networks & increasing importance of wireless comm & networks, ATM's
further development is limited.
