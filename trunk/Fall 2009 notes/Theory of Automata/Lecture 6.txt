Assignment 1 is extended until next Tuesday.
Answer key will be sent out sometime after.

|s| is # of symbols in s.

concatenation: x = good, y = bye, xy = goodbye
epsilon (greek E) is identity for concatenation of strings.
E is the empty set.  xE = Ex = x.

also associative, so (st)w = s(tw)

replication - a replicated 4 times is aaaa

these are all straightforward, but pay attention to the way they define the function.

if |w| = 0 then w(R) = w = {}
if |w| >= 1 then:
  (there exists an a that is a subset of Alphabet such that for some u in the Language w = ua.
  and then w(R) = a u(R)
  
it's a recursive definition.
basically, take the last letter, put at front, then reverse the rest of the string.

showed proof by induction of the concatenation and reverse.

he may give questions such as this in the exams.

subset / proper subset - proper means it can't be a subset of itself.

substring = aaa is substring of aaabbbaaa
proper substring - aaa is proper substring of aaaa, but is not proper substring of aaa.

prefix
eg. a is prefix of aa or ab, ab is prefix of ab or abb or whatever.
s is a proper prefix of t iff s is prefix of t and s != t

{} is a proper prefix of every non-empty string and is a prefix of all strings.

defining a language:
a language is a (finite or infinite) set of strings over a finite alphabet Sigma (E).

L can be all sorts of things, eg. any combo of {a, b}.
L can also be L = {}
is L = {{}} different?  Yes, the size is 1 rather than 0.

A halting problem language - an error = halt.  

Languages are sets.

A language E* (no constraints) is countably infinite.

A language is either finite or countably infinite.
Either situation, the language is countable.  tehre is no language that is not countable.

Concatenation of languages: if L1 and L2 are languages over E, then 
L1L2 = {w is a in E*, and there's some s in L1 where, for some t in L2, w = st}
eg.
L1 = {cat, dog}
L2 = {apple, pear}
L1L2 = {catapple, catpear, dogapple, dogpear}

can you concatenate languages in different alphabets...? possibly, but with the definition given, you must use the same sigmas for both (same alphabet.)


Kleene Star
L*  is set of strings that can be formed by concatenating together zero or more strings in L
eg.
L = {dog, cat, fish}
L* = {{}, doc, cat, fish, dogdog, dogcat, fishcatfish, fishdogdogfishcat, ....}
Note, {e} is always in L* ({e} is a set with 1 element (empty set), which is an identity for union.)
given a sigma E E* is largest possible defined on that sigma.
language L* is the biggest possible language defined on L, with L as alphabet.
that * is the kleene star
