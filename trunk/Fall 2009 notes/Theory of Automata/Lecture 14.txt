For some languages w/ a repeating pattern, REs are most useful.
FSMs are more useful when elements of L share some simple structural properties.




Final exam - more yes/no questions, less ambiguous.

This tower of hanoi can be decided by a FSM 


regular languages are always tractable.  when we ask if a language is regular / tractable, remember input is a number of states.
ToH: FSM input is different than input (not just '64') the size is exponential.

Example of 'Regular' : you choose what is "long enough"


"Pumping Theorem"
if L is regular, then every long string in L is pumpable.


Are non-regular languages solvable?

non-regular languages have different categories.
  context-free languages are solvable
  D (decidable) are solvable too
  SD (semidecidable) are as well
  (undecidable) - these are not solvable by any turing machine
  
  
Homework:
Change lambda to epsilon, looks nicer, then you ... ?

idk.  he showed us how to use JFLAP, it's pretty easy.

JFLAP lets you convert FA (FSM) to RE and such.

Name the (GA?) as the way he said it so it's easier to grade.
