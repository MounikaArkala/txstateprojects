Proof by case enumeration.
- sometimes bijectionis not as obvious, so you prove by finding a situation where an enumeration doesn't work.

countably infinite union - union of a countably infinite number of countably infinite sets is countably infinite.


diagonalization: used to show S is countably infinite, Powerset(S) is not countable.
eg. the set of integers.

a set that's not in the table: not(1), not(2), not(3), not(4), ....


can diagonalization also be used to show the countably infinite union is not countable either...?


reasoning about programs
correctness properties, including:
loop invariants: predicate I that describes a property that does not change during execution of an iterative process.

coffee can problems - coffee can contains some white benas and some black beans.  until no further beans cna be removed,
- randomly choose 2 beans
- if same color, throw both away and add a new black bean
- if different colors, throw away the black one and return the white one to the can.

the parity of white beans does not change.

a framework for analyzing problems
- we need a single framework in which we can analyze a very diverse set of problems.
the framework we will use is "Lanugage Recognition"
a language is a possibly infinite set of finite length strings over a finite alphabet.

assignment - typed or pen.  write very clearly.
