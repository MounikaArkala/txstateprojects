a)
{{}, {apple}, {pear}, {banana}, {apple, pear}, {apple, banana}, {pear, banana}, {apple, pear, banana}}

b)
{{}, {a}, {b}, {a, b}} - {{}, {a}, {c}, {a, c}} = {{b}, {a, b}}

c)
{{}}

d)
{a, b} x {1, 2, 3} = {{a, 1}, {a, 2}, {a, 3}, {b, 1}, {b, 2}, {b, 3}}
cartesian product of any set with {} is an empty set.
{{a, 1}, {a, 2}, {a, 3}, {b, 1}, {b, 2}, {b, 3}} x {} = {}

e)
x is a natural number that is both less than or equal to 7 and greater than or equal to 7.  it must be 7 then.
{7}

f)
x is a natural number where, for natural numbers < 10, x = number+2.
so the set of natural numbers < 10 is
{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
and the set we're looking for is
{2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11}

g) 
x is a natural number where there are two other natural numbers y and z such that x = y+z, y<5, and z < 4.
z is one of these values
{0, 1, 2, 3}
and y is
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
therefore our set is all possible sums of these numbers, or
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}

2.
a) Yes, father is one-to-one.  For a function to be one-to-one, all inputs must map to a unique output.  That means there is a constraint where
no child can be the child of two different fathers.  This is true for the standard definition of fathers.
b) Yes, father is onto.  In order for a child to exist (children are the range in this case) it must have a father.
Therefore there is always a father that maps to a given child.

3.
a) Exists(x) (V(x) ^ S(x, 3) ^ NOT(O(x, "STUPID"))) -> E(x, "A")

b) Exists(x) (B(x, 'R') ^ NOT(B(x, 'K')) ^ S(x, 1))

4.
a) Yes, any negative integer x and negative integer y can be subtracted to yield another negative integer z that is in the set of negative numbers.

b) No, for example, -1 / -2 yields 0.5, which is both nonnegative and noninteger. 
The division of two negative integers will always yield a positive number.
Therefore, the closure would contain all positive rational numbers. 
(0 is not a part of the set of negative integers, so 0 is not part of the closure.)

c) Yes, any positive integer to a power of a positive integer is just a repeated multiplication of that same positive integer with itself.
And multiplication of positive integers is already closed.

d) Yes, any two sets that take cartesian products will result in a finite set as well,
much in the same way that two finite numbers can be multiplied to make another finite number.

e) No.  The list of odd integers is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ...}
The remainder of a value % 3 is going to be in {0, 1, 2}.
3 % 3 = 0,
1 % 3 = 1,
5 % 3 = 2,
0 and 2 are not in the list of odd integers.
Therefore, to form a closure, include 0 and 2 in the set.

f) A rational number is defined as a number that can be expressed as the quotient a/b of two integers, where b != 0.
Therefore, we can say that for addition of any two rational numbers, they can be expressed as
a/b + c/d .
There will be some factor q and another factor r such that
q(b) = r(d)
Then the operation can be rewritten as 
(qa + rc)/ (rd)
if you take the values e = (qa + rc) and f = rd
you get the relationship
e/f.
However, because q and r may not be integers,
the values e and f are no longer guaranteed to be integers,
so the resulting fraction may not be a rational number.
In order to form a closure, you must include all irrational numbers as well.
So the closure is the real numbers.

5.
a) Suppose you have two countably infinite sets,
A = {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, .... 2k}
B = {0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, .... 2k+1}
It can be seen that these sets are mutually exclusive after the value "1".
Therefore the intersection can be defined as
{0, 1}
which is finite, even though both sets are countably-infinite.

b) Suppose you have two countably infinite sets,
A = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, .... 2k}
B = {1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, .... 2k}
A ^ B is defined as the set
{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, .... 2k}
Even though the values 0 and 1 are not included in the intersection,
the intersection is still countably infinite
(a finite number of values removed from a countably infinite series is still countably infinite.)

c) The set of real numbers is defined as an uncountable set.
Imagine a set A of all nonnegative real numbers (including 0)
and a set B of all negative real numbers plus 0.
Then A ^ B = {0} which is finite.

d) Suppose that the set A is all nonnegative real numbers.
The set B contains all negative real numbers as well as all even positive integers.
Then the intersection A ^ B is all of the even positive integers, which is a countably infinite set.

e) If a set is uncountable, you can remove a few elements and it will still be uncountable.
So an example with two different sets would be
A = all reals except for 0
B = all reals except for 1
A ^ B will be all reals except for 0 and 1, which will be uncountable.

6.
a) The statement says "for all x's there is some y that is less than x."  Both x and y are natural numbers.
This is satisfiable.  It is true for any x other than 0.
Proof where "x" != 0:
The set N is a countably infinite set.
The definition of a countably infinite set is that the set can be ordered in such a way as there
is a relationship between each element and there is a specific order where this relationship is true.
The values in N are arranged to be in ascending order, such that N[k] = N[k-1] + 1, and N[k+1] = N[k] + 1.
So for any nonnegative integer "k", N[k] = x.  There will also be another value N[k-1] that equals N[k] - 1.
Therefore, there will exist a "y" at N[k-1] that is equal to N[k] - 1 = x - 1.
Therefore, "y" is less than "x" and exists in the set N.

Proof where "x" = 0 is unsatisfiable:
Assume that, for x = 0, there is a y in N that is less than x.
The set {y in N | y < 0} is defined as {}.
Therefore, there is no value that "y" could attain that is less than x.
So our assumption was incorrect, and x cannot be 0 and still satisfy the sentence.

If a statement can be either true or false, it is defined as being "satisfiable".
Therefore, this sentence is satisfiable.


b) The statement says "for all x's there is some y that is greater than x."  Both x and y are natural numbers.
This is valid.
Proof:
The set N is a countably infinite set.
The definition of a countably infinite set is that the set can be ordered in such a way as there
is a relationship between each element and there is a specific order where this relationship is true.
The values in N are arranged to be in ascending order, such that N[k] = N[k+1] + 1, and N[k+1] = N[k] + 1.
So for any nonnegative integer "k", N[k] = x.  There will also be another value N[k+1] that equals N[k] + 1.
Therefore, there will exist a "y" at N[k+1] that is equal to N[k] + 1 = x + 1.
Therefore, "y" is greater than "x" and exists in the set N.


c) The statement says "for all x's there is some y such that f(x) = y."  Both x and y are natural numbers.
This is satisfiable.  
Proof:
"f" is defined as any function on the integers.  The function could be, for example, "f(x) = x-2",
which is satisfiable for all values of x besides 0 and 1.
"f(x)" could also be the function "f(x) = x" in which case the sentence would be valid.
The function "f(x) = -x" would be unsatisfiable, because the set N does not contain any negative numbers.

If a statement is always false it is unsatisfiable, and if it's always true it is valid.
This statement can be either depending on the definition of "f",
and can also be satisfiable.
Therefore, the statement is satisfiable.
