Regexes:

regular expresisons are useful becase each RE has a meaning.


remember - we are doing a union of sublanguages.


questions where " use a regular expression for FSM" or something? he says use the cheat.

regular grammer - some are specified as right regular grammar and some as left regular grammar.

RRG generates context-free languages.

instead of T -> Sa we have T -> aS
in LRG you generate right ot left rather than left to right.

ours is defined as RRG, because our FSMs consume strings left-to-right so RRG works better.
