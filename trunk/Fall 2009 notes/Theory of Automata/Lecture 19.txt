got to class way late.

Turing machines must always read and write.  if you don't wnat to overwrite a value, write the value you read back to the same location.  After you write you need to move the read head left or right.

Note:
- input tape is infinite in both directions.
turing machines do not necessarily halt.

the path (there's only one) may or may not end.
- FSMs are still practical (eg. building robots).
