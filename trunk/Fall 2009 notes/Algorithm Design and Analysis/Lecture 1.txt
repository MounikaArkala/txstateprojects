Intros and talking about desired classes.

Oleg Komogortsev.

Computer Science - study of algorithms.
Algorithms - step-by-step process that tells you steps you take to acheive a desired result.
baking recipes ~~ algorithms

This course is the main basis of CS.

information of class is on Syllabus on TRACS.

e-mail subjects: "CS5329:"

textbook - Algorithm Design - foundations, analysis, and internet examples. 

Homework must be typed.

Discussion is okay - just don't do the wrok together.

Attendance - get extra points.  


-----------------------------

CS is so widespread, you can be interdisciplinary.

original thinking - big point of algorithms.

don't start by asking "what you want me to code?"

mundane programmers are not going ot continue to be in demand.

original thinking is what we want to do.  in this class we don't just read a list of algorithms and implement them.

90% of programmers failed binary search.
- no formal methods
- no understanding of algorithmc design techniques
- abstract thinking

stuff to learn
- math (classifying functions, time complexity, time series/logarithms, recurrence relations)
- graph, search, recursive, hashing, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming.

All lectures are online - read before class!

explaining - explain algorithms to each other to help yourself learn it. talk to yourself out loud.

guesses and counter-examples - try to break your algorithm.  fix it, reiterate.
refinement is very important.

end of lecture

IDEA!!
calibrate based on eye distance apart? you can determine distance from screen then.  size of pupil to determine tilt (if they're different sizes).
