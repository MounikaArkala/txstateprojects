if you have the tree of N nodes, does it mean that if you go to any of those nodes and perform a rotation and at the end o I have to put the tree in a sequence again or just perform one rotation?
- has to be represented as a sequence,
and not the same as the initial sequence I guess
- first you have to say how you represent it as a sequence, and then how you will perform the rotation, and prove that this will be Omega(n) time.
but at the end it has to be in a sequence?
- you get a sequence as input and you output a sequence (b/c tree is represented by a sequence).
does the input sequence have to differ from the output sequence?
- yes, yes (looks slightly unsure.)

t/f problem 1.6.  sort is potentially unstable.



He's talking about a greedy algorithm.

you have an optimal global solution, but you may not reach it unless the problem has the greedy-choice property.

eg. if you are given coins and you want to return the minimum ones that will be created with it,
if you are given coins of value .32, .08 and .01, then you know that any amount over .32 must use a .32 coin to get the minimum # of coins.
- if you are given coins of value .30, .20, .05, .01, which doesn't have the 


assigning tasks to machines based on their start time also has a greedy property.

oral exam - he will send us an e-mail about it, if you don't get one by Friday night, you will not be given the oral exam.  it can also be thought of as an opportunity - if you answer all his questions, he will give a 100% on the final automatically.
