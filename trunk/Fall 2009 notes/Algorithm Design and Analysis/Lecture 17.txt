dynamic programming
- lets us solve problelms that are usually exponential in polynomial time.

polynomial is O(n^p) where p is constant.
exponential is O(p^n) where p is a constant.

there are many mathematical problems that aren't solved yet....

greedy approach to something about matrices?

he encourages us to read the book and will have lots of questions next time...

Wednesday is a break for everyone.  we are not having class on Wednesday, we will meet next Monday.
