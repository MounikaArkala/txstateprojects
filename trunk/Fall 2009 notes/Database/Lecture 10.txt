Let's assume all attribute relations are defined correctly.
- what is wrong with the diagram he shows us?  something is not quite right.
- how do we correct it?

- supply item is not really relevant to the rest of the items.
also, if there is not a patient using a surgical item, then 

- patients may be treated by multiple wards

- there is 

- staff should probably work at the facility instead of the ward because some of the staff (eg. the janitors) work throughout the facility.

-- many to many items shouldn't be in the diagram.

his problem:
he looked at the tables
-relations are generated/ created by attributes, not by your imagination.
- you can't arbitrarily create attributes, the primary key needs to determine the table.
he is looking at the table, not the attributes.

Diagnoses should go through Order.


Break up items
- break up patient/medical item, think about if anything goes with it.  if it does, you need to break relationship.  if nothing does, then the many-many may be acceptable.




------------

Customer
order
invoice
payment
product

he wants us to do:
- figure out the primary key & attributes of each table,
- build a model.

- you can add/delete tables if you want.  this is not 100% what the tables are.

- put all the attributes there

-pick out primary / foreign keys
- relationships

- draw E-R diagram


in exam, he may give us a model that has some imperfections and expect us to make corrections.

this model is partially correct / partially wrong.  so let's just throw it away?

the most important thing: in between customer and product - should only be order.  he put invoice there.


- order line is necessary
- where are you supposed to put the order line?


the next one
- the center should contain the important information.
