140-160 10
120-139 14
below    3


exam will be short, probably no definitions.

talk about the answer to problem 6?  idk.  

DBA = database administrator
DA = data administration.

some companies put everything as DBA. 
DA is more logical-oriented, learnign the E-R model, etc.
DBA concentrates on software system, etc.  it does not handle the application.

DA is very big department in many companies.

-enforces standards, policies, and procedures
-determines data requirements
-develops conceptual and logical database design

if you want to see the sample projects come by and look at them so you will know what he expects.



everything you want to correct - correct it in the final project.  because the E-R model was the first time, we were allowed to be wrong.  If your final project is very good, he will ignore everything else we did before.

turn in final project on the day of the demonstration.

th emost important thing is your final projecft paper, final project demo, and our 2 exams, and our E-R model.  he will look at E-R model again.

all the little stuff probably counts as 1 factor. 

MCS 590 is the room of the project demo. 
wednesday 9:00 december 9th, and 5:00 PM december 11th (friday).

take 2-5 minutes.   each person 5 minutes would be 2 hrs.  so we'll try to be faster.

work hard to get it done!

next tuesday - we have exam 1 hr, then 1 hr lecture, then 20 minutes quiz.  quiz counts toward the second exam.
