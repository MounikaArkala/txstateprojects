projects:

#1
    program that will autodelete stuff from a folder after 'x' days of existence,
    or after 'x' days of accessing, it will prompt you and you can postpone it for x days
    or you can delete it or cancel the autodelete forever for that file.
    the prompt will have a 'postpone' button that is automatically selected,
    a 'cancel' button that cancels the autodelete, and a check box that enables
    a box that says "delete now".  There should be a main UI page where it will show
    you the pending deletions and you can go ahead and do them there.

 - generate a sine wave with a specific frequency
 - have a buffer of say 20 items.  you refresh the buffer as a ring.
 each item you refresh is an instantaneous measurement of the input wave, and you
 compare it with the reference sine wave.  if they are different, you set the buffer to their difference.
