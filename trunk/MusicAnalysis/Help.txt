12-Tone Help

This tool relates to the analysis of atonal music.
The purpose of this tool is to take a series of 12 notes that don't repeat, and generate
the 12-tone matrix / table that contains all of the values in it.
It is important to be aware that a series of notes containing notes that appear different,
such as A# and Bb, do not contain 12 musically-distinct notes.
A# relates to the same pitch as Bb does, under the most common (equal-tempered) tuning and notation.
A message will alert you if some of your notes are not unique.

Once a row of 12 unique notes has been entered, for example,
A F# G Ab E F B Bb D C# C Eb
you can either press "enter" or click "Submit".
If the tone row does not work for one reason or another, an error message may be displayed.
The only errors will be where the length of notes is not correct, some notes are invalid (such as Qb or Rb),
or some notes are not unique.

If the tone row passes the error checks, a 12-tone table will be displayed containing all of the
primes, retrogrades, and prime inversions / retrograde inversions, of the row.

A prime of a row is the row shifted up x semitones.
For example, the 0th prime of a row is the row shifted up 0 semitones, so it's the same as the original input.
The 3rd prime of
A F# G Ab E F B Bb D C# C Eb
is
C A Bb B G Ab D C# F E Eb F#

which is just A up 3 semitones (A = 0, A# = 1, B = 2, C = 3).

An inversion is just that prime but with the steps reversed.
For example, if the first two notes of the row are
A F#
then for the 0th inversion, the first two notes are
A C
because C is the same distance in semitones from both F# and C.


A retrograde is simply a prime in reverse.  So the retrograde of
A F# G Ab E F B Bb D C# C Eb
will be
Eb C C# D Bb B F E Ab G F# A


Once the table is presented, it can be inspected visually.  However, if you want to see everywhere a specific
sequence occurs in the table, search boxes are provided.  The order-independent series search is used
when searching for a series of notes where you don't care the order.
For example, if you want to find any of these:
F E Ab
F Ab E
E F Ab
E Ab F
Ab E F
Ab F E
you would use the order-independent search with any of those as an input.
If you use the order-dependent search, your search will be restricted exclusively to values that fit exactly
with that search string.  Eg. F E Ab will *only* find rows or columns that contain exactly that sequence,
and it will not try any of the other possible permutations.

The "enable wraparound" checkbox is to determine if you'd like your searches to wrap around the column/row end.
For example, if you have the prime row 
A F# G Ab E F B Bb D C# C Eb
and you search for
C Eb A F#

You will not find it if wraparound is disabled; it's not contained in that row directly.
However, if wraparound *is* enabled, then it will match the row starting at the 10th note ( C ).

Scales Help:

The scales tool knows a lot of scales.  It knows approximately 55 different ones.
The purpose of the tool is to find out which scales contain a specific set of notes.
For example, if I would like to find all scales which contain the notes A C E, I can
type that into the "Notes:" field and hit "enter" (or click "submit").
My result will be a page containing a very long list of scales
(A C E is a note, its fifth, and its minor third, which is very common note pattern,
so it will occur in many scales.)  A more detailed note pattern, such as A C E F G#,
will be in far fewer scales.

Now that you know what the purpose of the tool is, it's important to know how to use it.

The search page contains two entries and one checkbox.
The first entry field, "Notes:", is the regular search.  This just searches all of the scales
for a matching string of notes, in any order it wants.  So a search for A C E and C E A and E A C
will all return the same result.

The second entry field, "Ordered Notes", is a special search for when you know exactly what order
you want the notes in already.  So A C E and C E A will have quite different results.

The check box, "require consecutive notes" is for when you are certain your notes do not have any
other notes between them.
So if searching for A C E ordered, but without "require consecutive notes", you will get
about 45 scales as a result.  An example of a result is the Blues Scale in A, which is
A C D D# E G A
and as you can see, A C E does occur in that scale, in order, but there are extra notes (D D#) in between.

If you search with "require consecutive notes", you will get
only a single result , the Oriental Scale, as
G A C E F G
because that is the only scale that contains all the notes, A C E,
in that order (because we did an ordered search) and with no other notes between them.

Once a search has been performed, you will be presented with a list of scales.  This list may be quite large;
therefore, the facility to filter your results was added.
Any types of music that you do not wish to include in the result (say, Blues music) you can simply
deselect its check box, and the page will reload without any of those results included.

The filtering system is relaxed. For example, if you search for A C E, one of the scales
you will come up with is the Mixolydian Scale.  If you remove Jazz from the filter list,
the Mixolydian scale will still be present in the list, because it is used in other music types,
such as Modern Art.  An item will only not show up in the scales list if ALL of its music types
are turned off by the filter.  Just turning off one has no effect.

---
One thing to note is that the tool translates all input into a specific encoding.
So even if you include a Bb, it will display this value as A#.  Also, all
scales that should be written in flatted form will be written in sharped form.
In fact, all scales are written in sharped form.  No other notation is supported by the tool as of
the writing of this document.
