Everything

- allow submit by Enter on all pages
- provide checking on input so it doesn't crash w/ valid input - do checking both in Python and in Javascript so that even if they try to eff w/ the code it will still be fine.



Primes
CHECK- do the wrapping around code


add prettifying code (highlighting the series) to a func
- clean up primes.cgi code
- add documentation
- modify prime so it doesn't reload table.

Scales 

- force length of input to scales to be between 3 and 12 notes.
- deal with duplicate notes (what if they put A A A ? discard duplicate notes!) (convert to set?)
- add rating of how common each scale is. ### he doesn't like this idea.
