Token / request
when process pi sends request to pj, the timestamp will be used to modify the request variable of pj
the Ti will be updated w/ new timestamp from pi.
pj releases token to new process, checks next value.  if newer value in Request than Token...
Token is the last time j+1 was given token, j+1 in Request is the last time it made a request.
If it has made a request, and hasn't gotten a token (I.e. token timestamp is older than request timestamp)
you give it token and update timestamp.
