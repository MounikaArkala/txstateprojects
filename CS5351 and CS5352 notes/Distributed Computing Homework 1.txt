1. (15 pts)
(1) Describe two issues that are common to both distributed systems and
computer networks.


(2) Describe two issues that exist only in distributed system.



2. (15 pts) For the transaction shown in Figure 1 please write a program
that uses fork and join constructs to implement the transaction.
# General method:
# Take the left-side down the tree,
# forking any process that branches to the right.
# create a variable to use to rejoin the right branch back
# when it's done.

S1;
count1 := 2; # for when we join the S3 branch back.
Fork L1;     # this is because S3 occurs to the right.
S2;          
S4;
Fork REJOIN1;
S5;
count2 := 2;
GOTO REJOIN2;

L1: S3;

REJOIN1: Join count1;
S6;

REJOIN2: Join count2;
S7;

#This solution assumes that code will continue through if
#it doesn't meet a GOTO (I.E. the FORK L1 process will execute S3,
#and then it will continue through the REJOIN1:label and perform a join count1,
#then execute S6, then continue through the REJOIN2: label and
#perform a join count2, then execute S7.


3. (15 pts. Problem 3.2, p.128) The Internet is far too large for any router to
hold routing information for all destinations. How does the Internet routing
scheme deal with this issue?
4. (10 + 20 = 30 pts)
(1) What is the most important factor that affects the accuracy of Cris-
tian's algorithm? Explain your answer.
(2) Provide two examples that show how Cristian's algorithm works.


5. (25 pts. Problem 11.4, p.465) A client attempts to synchronize with a
time server. It records the round-trip times and timestamps returned by the
server in the table below.
Which of these items should it use to set its clock? To what time should
it set it? Estimate the accuracy of the setting with respect to the server's
clock. If it is known that the time between sending and receiving a message
in the system concerned is at least 8 ms, do your answers change?
Round-trip (ms) Time(hr:min:sec)

25 10:54:25.450
