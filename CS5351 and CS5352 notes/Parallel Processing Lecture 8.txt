Proessor arrays
 - a vector computer implemented as a sequential computer (Front-end) connected to a set of identical and synchronized processing elements capable of performing the same operation on different data.

almost every HPC today has shared memory.
no commercial Shared-Memory SIMD processor array systems were built - it's impossible to allow simultaneous access to any p locations.
physically your read-writes must be sequential.

SMC went bankrupt in early 90's.  Oracle bought it.

PARIS = Parallel Instructino Set of Connection Machine
- provides a variety of operations similar to a typical machine's instruction set.
virtual processsors - PARIS supports this, so you can use as many virtual processors as you want.
