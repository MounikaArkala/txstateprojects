Partitioned algorithms - a big class of problems.
partition algorithms can be subdivided into prescheduled and self-scheduled algorithms.

Why do we study differetnt meshes / trees / hypercubes?
processor organizations.
20-25 years ago they were very important.

synchronized algorithms make synchronization not a concern.
communication costs aren't zero though.  it may dominate, actually.

shuffle exchange network requires very few connections.  in terms of hardware costs, in terms of hardware costs.
however, hardware costs are so cheap people just use switches.

I don't understand shuffle-exchange at all.  look it up!!!

basic idea of shuffle-exchange is simple and clear for parallel reduction - you just shuffle-exchange log-n times.

two phases in parallel reduction algorithm

switches give you flexibility.

he goes over summation pseudocode.
