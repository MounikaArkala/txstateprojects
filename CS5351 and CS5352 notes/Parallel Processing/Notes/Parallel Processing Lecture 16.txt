At the end of the for i for loop, you need to synchronize the processors.

Lecture 7: sorting.

strategies of two sorts are the same.
internal sorting - all elements ao-an-1 can be brought into main memory at once and sort inside memory.

Given "n" elements, the subscript for a {0, 1, ... n-1}
how many possible orderings can we have?

Each leaf node in a decision tree represents one possible ordering.
n! time.  how do we deal w/ it?

we assume it's a binary decision tree made by n elements.
Assume the height of tree is k, then # of leaf nodes is 2^K
2^K >= n! >= (n/2)^(n/2)

In HW 1 - Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm,
you were supposed to see possibility that the # of nodes, edges = n * n-1 -2,
create 1 process for each spanning tree, after process has verified it...

Final exam - in San Marcos.  should know by next week.

Final exam - open book. 2 1/2 hours.   format - final exam is curved.  

The IT guys will assign a room for us, most likely 240 / 241 in Derrick.
