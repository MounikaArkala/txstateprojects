Friday will be final. 8-10:30 PM, not sure which 

sorting & searching are very important (science / engineering)

grad students who do not know matrix multiplication is a deficiency.
learn how to do it on your own.
2d mesh -- we want to distribute values evenly across the mesh.

a centralized algorithm - no need of communication.

0 talking about SIMD-MC^2 model algorithm
Because of lower boundto achieve lower bound
parallel algorithm - can't reduce below the # of operations of sequential algo,
can just do them in parallel.

in the first iteration the first processor's value does not move.  every value but first
in column / row will be moved left/up.


- we have more efficient algorithms for solving on hypercubes, but it's rather unconventional.


can we come up with algorithm ?  note n^3 is magic number
in sequential operation, n^3 is total number of operations - each c,i,j needs n paired multiplications.
in our algorithm we can use special requirement - # of processors = n^3.

if you can do this right, each process is only doing 1 multiplication.
total complexity of algo is log(n)
if it takes you more than log(n) time to send values across the hypercube, you won't be able to make it optimal
efficiency.
