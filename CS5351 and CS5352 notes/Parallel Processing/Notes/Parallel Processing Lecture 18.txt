Since we're going down to a two layer model, why not just do one layer?
well there's no advantage to this, apparently.

Bitonic merge sort

speedup of hypercube n / lgn - sequential complexity nlgn, algorithm is lg^2n so one over the other.
CRCW PRAM algorithm - normal speedup is nlgn/ lgn = n
but that algorithm is not real.


Sequential quick-sort algorithm - if list is very small
