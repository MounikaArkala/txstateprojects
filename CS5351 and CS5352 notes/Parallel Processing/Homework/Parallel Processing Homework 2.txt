Shuffle-exchange network n=8 nodes.
initially node i holds value i, 0 <= i <= n-1
steps (shuffle/exchange) needed to reach state where node i 
holds value n - 1 - i, 0 <= i <= n-1
Our current state:
node   value
0       0
1       1
2       2
3       3
4       4
5       5
6       6
7       7

Our goal state:
node   value
0       7
1       6
2       5
3       4
4       3
5       2
6       1
7       0
